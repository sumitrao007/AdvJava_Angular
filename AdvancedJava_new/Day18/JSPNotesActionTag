JSP actions Tags:
 - To minimize/eliminate Java code from JSP, it is recommended to use various "tags" instead of java code (scriptlet/expressions).
	- JSP actions -- <jsp:____ ... />
 - <jsp:forward page="..." /> 
		--->It same as work like Request Dispatcher rd.forward(req, resp); 
 - <jsp:include page="..." /> 
		--->It same as work like Request Dispatcher rd.include(req, resp);
	  -	Like include page directive this action is also used to insert a JSP file in another file
 - <jsp:useBean .../>
	* With the help of use bean we eliminate java code such as to request.getparameter("username")
	 
	 * <jsp:useBean id="name" class="pkg.BeanClass" scope="?"/>
		- scope: page | request | session | application
		- page --> bean is stored as pageContext attribute.
			bean is accessible only on that page only for that request.
			this is default scope.
		- request --> bean is stored as request attribute.		
			bean is accessible on all pages to which req is fwded or incled.

		- application --> bean is stored as servletContext attribute.
			bean is accessible in all reqs to all pages accessed by all users
		
	
	* <jsp:setProperty .../>
